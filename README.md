# Con-compress
This ML model helps predict the value of a Compressive Strength Test: Compression testing is a very common testing method that is used to establish the compressive force or crush resistance of a material (In this case concrete) and the ability of the material to recover after a specified compressive force is applied and even held over a defined period of time.
