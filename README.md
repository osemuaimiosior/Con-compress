# Con-compress
This ML model helps predict the value of a Compressive Strength Test: Compression testing is a very common testing method that is used to establish the compressive force or crush resistance of a material (In this case concrete) and the ability of the material to recover after a specified compressive force is applied and even held over a defined period of time.

# Why Compressive Strength Test of Concrete is Important?
The compressive strength of the concrete cube test provides an idea about all the characteristics of concrete. By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not.
